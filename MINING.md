Electric Cash mining
====================

The total supply of Electric Cash is currently capped at 21,000,000 coins.  
A fixed supply helps to minimize potential inflation and dilution. 
Electric Cash (ELCASH) mining is launched from a fresh genesis block. 

Pre-mining is planned to continue until 10 percent of the supply is mined and allocated to activities including, but not limited to:

- Promotional airdrops 
-	Business development 
-	Additional rewards for stakers 
-	Marketing efforts 
-	Social media advertisements  
-	Software budget 


During the following period, the block reward will amount to 75. Each subsequent period it will gradually decrease.
Electric Cash has been designed with a community governance system, so all parameters can be changed if required.
